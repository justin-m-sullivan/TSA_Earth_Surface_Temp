# Exploring Texas Land Temperatures Using Time Series Analysis


## Project Goal: Using time series analysis to explore Texas Land Temperature Data from 1820 to 2013, can I build a model to forecast land temperatures for the next year, cycle, and or season?


## Data Dictionary

**LandAverageTemperature:** global average land temperature in celsius
**LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty:** the 95% confidence interval around the average


## Key Findings
- Temperature Uncertainity has a larger spread prior to 1900. As time progresses and the temperature uncertainty decreases, predicting Texas land temperatures is more accurate and this is likely due to the technolgical advances in measuring more accurate temperatures.

## Steps to Replicate

1. Read this readme
2. Download the [GlobalLandTemperature Data By State](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?select=GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv) from Kaggle and save locally to .csv
3. Open the texas_land_temps_explore.ipynb file in this repo
